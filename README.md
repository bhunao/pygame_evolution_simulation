# Pygame Evolution Simulation

This is a simulation of a neural network implemented using the Pygame library in Python. The purpose of the simulation is to showcase the behavior of small organisms with limited inputs and outputs while they evolve.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- NEAT-Python

## Usage
To run the simulation, simply execute the following command:
```shell
python main.py
```

The simulation will start running and Pygame will open a window showing the cells moving around.

## Configuration
`config.py`: This file contains settings related to the simulation, such as the screen dimensions.
`config.txt`: This file contains settings related to the evolution and the NEAT algorithm.

## Credits
This simulation was based on the [NEAT-Python](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/) library developed by CodeReclaimers.
